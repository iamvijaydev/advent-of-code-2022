# advent-of-code-2022
First-time participation. I'm planning to do it entirely with a functional programming paradigm. If you are new to FP, please checkout: [Mostly Adequate](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) on github.

I will be adding utils to `/fp` folders as I progress. If I ever have to use ADT (algebraic data types), I'll create a `/adt` folder.

## TODO
- [ ] Allow user to provide input via CLI.
