# advent-of-code-2022
First-time participation. I'm planning to do it entirely with a functional programming paradigm. If you are new to FP, please checkout: [Mostly Adequate](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) on github.

## Notes:
- I will be adding utils to `/fp` folders as I progress.
- If I ever have to use ADT (algebraic data types), I'll create a `/adt` folder.
- I have purposefully excluded `curry` util for now. If I ever endup with three or higher arity, I will create it. I will also refactor code where `curry` can be used.

## TODO
- [ ] Allow user to provide input via CLI.
